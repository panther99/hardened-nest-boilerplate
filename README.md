  <p align="center">üõ°Ô∏è Nest boilerplate with hardened configuration</p>

## Description

This is a modified boilerplate based on [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

It includes the following:

* [ts-reset](https://github.com/total-typescript/ts-reset)
* AirBnB's ESLint configuration with `null` disabled and extended with:
  * Configuration for imports
  * Configuration for Jest
* Stricter TypeScript configuration

## Why?

This boilerplate was created with the intention of allowing Nest developers to work on their applications without having to worry about the most common pitfalls of JavaScript and TypeScript during development and code reviews. It could be tuned based on user's preferences.
